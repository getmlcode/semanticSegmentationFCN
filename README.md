# Semantic Segmentation
This repository has framework for training, validation and inference of semantic segmentation models, but currenty it only supports FCN.
I have used it to train <b>Fully Convolutional Network</b> and detect road in a given scene using learnt model.  

Developed using Tensorflow.

# Training Progress
### Epoch 5 --> 10 --> 15 on validation data

# Training Details

# Usage Guide
# Future Work
Add GUI for both training and inference for user interaction.  
Develop a website to provide this as a web service.  
Extend/Modify this framework to supprt other semantic segmentation models.
